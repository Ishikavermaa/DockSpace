# 🚀 Docker Bridge: Balancing Isolation & Connectivity

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this exercise is to explore and demonstrate **network isolation** in Docker containers. We will examine how containers within the same **custom bridge network** can communicate, while those on different networks remain **isolated**. Understanding this is crucial for securing microservices and containerized applications.

## 🌐 Introduction to Docker Networking
Docker networking is fundamental for **containerized applications**, allowing containers to communicate while ensuring **security and isolation**. Docker provides several networking options:

### 🔹 Types of Docker Networks:
- **Bridge Network (Default)** – Allows communication between containers using internal IPs unless restricted.
- **Custom Bridge Network** – Offers better control and supports name-based resolution.
- **Host Network** – Attaches containers directly to the host’s network stack.
- **Overlay Network** – Enables communication across multiple hosts (Docker Swarm).
- **Macvlan Network** – Assigns a MAC address to each container, making them appear as separate devices.
- **None Network** – Completely disables networking.

For this demonstration, we focus on the **custom bridge network**, which improves control and **network isolation**.

---

## ⚡ Why Use a Custom Bridge Network?
A **custom bridge network** offers several advantages:
✅ **Improved Security** – Containers on different networks are isolated by default.
✅ **Better Performance** – Direct communication without host networking stack overhead.
✅ **DNS-Based Resolution** – Containers communicate via names instead of IPs.
✅ **Greater Control** – Define specific **subnets, IP ranges, and gateways**.

To demonstrate, we create a **custom bridge network** called `vidhi-bridge` and connect multiple containers.

---

## 🔧 1. Creating a Custom Bridge Network
```bash
docker network create --driver bridge --subnet 172.20.0.0/16 --ip-range 172.20.240.0/20 vidhi-bridge
```
### 🔍 Explanation:
- `--driver bridge` → Uses the default **bridge network mode**.
- `--subnet 172.20.0.0/16` → Defines the network’s **IP range**.
- `--ip-range 172.20.240.0/20` → Allocates IPs **dynamically**.

---

## 🚀 2. Running Containers in the Custom Network
### Running **Redis Container** (`database`)
```bash
docker run -itd --net=bridge --name=database redis
```
### Running **BusyBox Container** (`server-A`)
```bash
docker run -itd --net=bridge --name=server-A busybox
```

### 📌 Check Container IPs
```bash
docker network inspect bridge
```
Expected Output:
```
 database: 172.20.240.1
 server-A: 172.20.240.2
```

---

## 📔 3. Testing Communication Between Containers
### Ping from **database** to **server-A**
```bash
docker exec -it database ping 172.20.240.2
```
### Ping from **server-A** to **database**
```bash
docker exec -it server-A ping 172.20.240.1
```
✅ Expected Outcome: Both containers should successfully **ping** each other.

---

## 🚧 4. Demonstrating Network Isolation with a Third Container
We add another container (`server-B`) on the **default bridge network**.
```bash
docker run -itd --name=server-B busybox
```
### 📌 Get IP of `server-B`
```bash
docker inspect -format='{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' server-B
```
(Example IP: `172.17.0.2`)

---

## ❌ 5. Testing Communication Between Different Networks
Ping from `database` to `server-B`:
```bash
docker exec -it database ping 172.17.0.2
```
🚨 **Expected Outcome:** The ping should **fail**, as they are on different networks.

---

## 🔍 6. Confirming Network Isolation
### Inspect Networks
```bash
docker network inspect bridge
docker network inspect bridge
```
✅ `bridge` should contain `database` & `server-A`.
✅ `bridge` should contain `server-B`.

---

## 🏆 Conclusion
- **Containers in the same network** can communicate.
- **Containers in different networks** are isolated **by default**.
- Docker’s **networking model** ensures security and separation unless explicitly connected.

🚀 **Now you have mastered Docker Bridge Networking!** 🎯
